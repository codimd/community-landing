The demo instance is a publicly available instance for trying out HedgeDoc and can be found at [demo.hedgedoc.org](https://demo.hedgedoc.org).

While notes and accounts on the demo instance are not deleted periodically, **you should not rely on the demo instance for production use**.  
**We cannot guarantee that your notes won't be lost** because of hardware or software malfunctions.
This is mainly due to the fact that this instance runs the latest unstable code from our repository.

To make the demo instance available with low latencies in as many countries as possible, we use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
One of the downsides is that Cloudflare intercepts all TLS traffic between your browser and the demo instance, which makes the demo unsuitable for private notes.

We generally recommend hosting your own instance for more than testing HedgeDoc's features.
