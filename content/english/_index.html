HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source, web-based, self-hosted, collaborative markdown editor.

You can use it to easily collaborate on notes, graphs and even presentations in real-time.
All you need to do is to share your note-link to your co-workers and they're ready to go.

Yes, this project was formerly known as CodiMD, but in 2020 we decided to rename our project to HedgeDoc to avoid confusion with another project of the same name.
